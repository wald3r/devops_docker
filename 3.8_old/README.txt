When to use Docker and what are the benefits?

Docker is a tool, which containerizes applications. One of the benefits is that the containerized application is isolated. Any kind of dependencies or the application itself will not affect the operating system. The isolation also offers more security. Especially when you separate an application in many parts and containerize them. Whenever one container then has a problem, the others are still secure.
Another big benefit is that you can reproduce a container on every device. The docker environment ensures that it will work splendidly.
There are many more benefits docker offers like an easy way to manage the whole environment, docker hub to publish and download images and it is easy to integrate certain applications in docker.

The benefit of isolation is one of the main reasons to use docker. You want to try something new but you do not know anything about the new technology you are going to use? Dockerâ€™s isolation ensures that it will not affect your operating system.
When there are many developers involved and everybody works on different machines and with different environments, docker can ensure that everybody starts developing on the same basis.
Furthermore, docker is always a good idea when it comes to basic use cases. A simple load balancer, databases or webservers are quickly deployed.
